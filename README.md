Have your own Tamagotchi in your CLI :).

A project to learn GO and CLI apps.

## TODO


- [x] Basic functions

- [ ] Sound alerts?
- [ ] Time based events
- [ ] Handling Tamagotchi "sleeping" when it's stopped (basically calculating actions since the last time it was awake)
- [ ] Handling death of age and hunger/lack of happiness
- [ ] Handling sickness and medicine
